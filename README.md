# Hi — I’m Anish 👋

I build production-grade web and cloud platforms that scale. I focus on resilient architectures, developer experience, and measurable business outcomes. I turn complex domain problems into clean, well-tested systems and contribute to open source.

- 🔭 Currently building: scalable backend systems, automation tooling, and developer workflows  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced distributed systems patterns, observability, and secure-by-design engineering  
- 👯 Open to: backend & cloud engineering roles, contract work, and OSS collaboration  
- 💬 Ask me about: system design, TypeScript, Python, CI/CD, containerization

## Selected projects

### Aimgrit Digital Solutions
A modular platform for SMBs that automates operational workflows, order management, and reporting. I led backend design, built resilient microservices, and implemented observability and CI/CD pipelines.  
Tech: TypeScript · Node.js · PostgreSQL · Docker · GitHub Actions  
(Replace with live repo link and add impact metrics, e.g., "Handles X orders/day" or "Reduced API latency by Y%".)

### CakeBiss
End-to-end e-commerce platform for artisanal bakeries (D2C). I contributed to the customer web app and order-management microservices, integrated payments and inventory flows, and improved delivery reliability.  
Tech: React · Node.js · Stripe · Docker · Kubernetes  
(Add repo URL and a short metric, e.g., "Improved checkout conversion by X%".)

### ClearTax (integration / automation)
Automation and integration work for tax-compliance workflows. Implemented secure API integrations, robust validation, and pipeline automation to reduce manual filing steps.  
Tech: Python · Go · API design · Workflow automation  
(Add repo URL and measurable outcomes if available.)
